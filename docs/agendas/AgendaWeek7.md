Date:           {23/03/2020}\
Main focus:     {Preparing for submission}\
Note taker:     {Fran√ßois Ezard}\

# Opening
*Here you check that everybody is present.*

# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action
*The items below are things you should look into after the first meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*
- Work on testing server side code
- Implement restrictions on reservations
- Fix client side code quality (checkstyle issues)
- Start working on the report

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*
- Can the videos be screen recordings displaying the application?
- Is a webcam sufficient for the video quality expected?
- How does losing a group member affect the rest of the group?

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
