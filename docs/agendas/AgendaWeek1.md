*Here you check that everybody is present.*

# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action
*The items below are things you should look into after the first meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*
 - Read Resources and Tools (on BrightSpace)
 - Make sure everyone has Mattermost
 - Add every group members name and e-mail to the README file
 - Make sure everyone has and knows how to use sourcetree
 
# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions
- How often do we meet with the client?
- How are the assignments evaluated (individually or group)?

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
