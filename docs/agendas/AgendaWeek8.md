## Agenda Week 8

Date:           {30/03/2020}\
Main focus:     {Checking what Features are yet to be implemented}\
Note taker:     {Fran√ßois Ezard}\

# Opening
*Here you check that everybody is present.*

# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action
*The items below are things you should look into after the first meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*
- Finish testing controllers
- Clean up checkstyle issues
- Merge into master and open up new branches from there
- Finish last few remaining features

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*
-- How do you write client side tests on controllers since there's no repositories to mock?
- By when are we going to get feedback on the report?

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
