In italics you will find some additional explanations of the agenda points. You will find mostly the same points in the next agendas.

# Opening
*Here you check that everybody is present.*
All Present

# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action
- Set priorities to different features (critical, important etc.)
- Have functioning API Endpoints
- Create conceptual schema for the database
- Decide what frameworks we are going to use

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*
- Do we have to use the recommended frameworks?
- What tools should we use to design a logical schema for the database?
- Is it possible to have two people connecting to the database on MySQL workbench simultaneously?

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
