## Agenda Week 5

Date:           {09/03/2020}\
Main focus:     {Meeting with client}\
Note taker:     {Fran√ßois Ezard}\

# Opening
*Here you check that everybody is present.*

# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action
*The items below are things you should look into after the first meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*
- Authenticating the users, and making a distinction between the type of users (student, teacher & admin)
- Password encoding through hashing
- Working on admin UI 
- Adding a table into the database keeping track of when holidays and days off are
- Reservations of bikes, rooms and main view for buildings

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*
- What frameworks are most appropriate for authenticating users for our situation?
- What algorithms are recommended for hashing the passwords?
- Should users be given the ability to logout and if so how should we handle it? Should they be return to the login page?

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
