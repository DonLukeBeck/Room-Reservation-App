# Opening
*Here you check that everybody is present.*

# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action
*The items below are things you should look into after the first meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*
- Fixing the remaining checkstyle issues
- Complete Javadoc comments
- Cleanup branches and merge into master
- Implement adding personal events to the schedule
- Start creating restrictions on reservations

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*
- How does the coronavirus situation affect how we are going to be graded?
- 

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
