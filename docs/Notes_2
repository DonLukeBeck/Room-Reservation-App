Week 2 meetings 17/02/20
    CTA notes:
        -Make a digital version of our tree/workflow and upload it to gitlab.

        -Make document/list with priorities, from essential to lowest priority and upload it to gitlab.
            -Bullet points on requirements, very specific/not vague
        -e.g. User should be able to see their reservations, maybe in the form of a list.
        (essential)
             -We make it a calender instead of a list.
        (additional feature, has lower priority)

        -Add Food Courts to buildings
            -You should be able to order food whenever the building is open to rooms or a
        possible pick-up spot.
                -NOTE, users aren't able to order food from one building to another.
            -Users should be able to view a menu in the application, preferably including prices.
            -Users should pay up front (in person), not online/on our application.

        -Food courts, bikes and rooms aren't linked and should be viewed as separate entities.
            -All three are not available whenever the building is closed

        -Booking rooms
            -2 to 4 weeks booking ahead of time
            -Possibly limit the amount of reservations per day
            -Students aren't allowed to book 2 rooms at the same time
        -However, give more flexibility to employees
            -Employees are allowed to book certain rooms students can't, e.g. exam rooms

        -Time slots
            -Time slots have been decided on 30 minutes
            -We need to take into account the opening hours of the buildings

        -Try to make our application user friendly, this helps both the user and developer.
